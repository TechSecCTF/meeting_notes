# Cryptography

Cryptography is the study of secure communication. But like all areas of security, it is easy for developers to make mistakes implementing cryptography, which is why we try to find these vulnerabilities and exploit them in CTFs.

## Base 64

_Challenge 1_  
`aV9saWtlX2NyeXB0bw==`

Whenever you see alphanumeric characters, possibly with + and = signs, you are likely looking at a base 64 encoding!

## Caesar Cipher

_Challenge 2_
`fqoteqo{k4k_e3ogd1fk}`


## One Time Pad
_Challenge 3_  
Here are two 121-character English strings encrypted with the same “one-time pad”. Decrypt the ciphertexts.  
`ac9e7ee66ce8f76ba32653ba5e4f4a0c144942a439136db5d3157f935c9571f52f412e7ac0d4b589feed2f9bef1211ef6cbcc47e1178775c945efcdb3777665118ca988f1b2158730e2ef52ea245d83cefff97e1b2938e166ec5d77e87b6317fddada5ecbd1d4f`  
`C2 = "bda6685c8c86c69f5a34e82664e6a251d95ced3f254967252be8e4afc6287c7f2212a390d57887dfb917faca122c9429d743e1764637c445f6e9275fe5b2969195b1223677492d341e1f7a624cfb2a881f4b731c3e4c91ebbd88f56a773ba7fa9c4e58f7d9d4f"`  
Use the code in `one-time-pad.py` to get started.  

## RSA
_Easy challenge:_ http://techsec.scripts.mit.edu/rsa.txt  
_Hard challenge:_ http://techsec.scripts.mit.edu/broadcast.txt

## Info Session Challenges
_Challenge 4_  
`AljoZlj{Ulc3y_BzL_Jhlz@y_j1wOLY}`  
  
_Challenge 5_  
`5d6c6a615a6c6a724740676c56607a564856657c4a427056675c644b6c7b74`
