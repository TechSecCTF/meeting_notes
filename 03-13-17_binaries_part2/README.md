# Binary Workshop (Part 2)
The first step in learning to exploit programs is understanding how they work.
This guide is going to cover ELF executables specifically, but the knowledge is

compiled programs as *binaries*. Binaries are composed of machine code, an
extremely rudimentary set of instructions that are specific to the CPU.
